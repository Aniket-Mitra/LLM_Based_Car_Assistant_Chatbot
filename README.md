**Details** - I worked on building a driving assistance conversation agent which takes query/command from the user regarding different car & driving-related functionalities like inquiry about weather or navigation path, steering assistance, using car features like Bluetooth, AC, etc., or commands like opening/closing car windows/doors, even advanced functionality scheduling meetings, booking tickets, etc. and by understanding the intent of the command can provide an appropriate response.
